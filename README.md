# Feast
Less line-waiting, more enjoyment

With Feast you have less line-waiting, and more enjoyment. Feast is a crowd-sourcing app for Android that uses the power of user data collection to track the amount of people in the lines of businesses. Add to the data with the app so you can inform other users, and make sure your next restaurant, concert or TeenHacks hackathon, isn't full with a large line!

Built as a part of the [TeenHacks Hackathon](https://teenhacks.org) in only _7 Hours_
